## Biography

I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at Alibaba, focusing on large language models, multimodal models, and their applications in search ads, under the leadership of [Jian Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=30VZBsIAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I was a researcher at SenseTime, where I worked on computer vision and neural architecture search with [Ming Sun](https://msunming.github.io/), Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/), and Dr. [Junjie Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rEYarG0AAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, I researched object detection and segmentation at Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning (IDL) under [Shilei Wen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zKtYrHYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

I earned my master’s degree from the School of Computer Science at Beijing Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Yuwei Wu and Prof. Yunde Jia.
